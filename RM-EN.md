## A precursory statement

* The atlas is originally manufactured by a Japanese man [x768](http://x768.com/w/twha.ja). X768 published the atlas on his/her personal website without providing any licence. Any use, except in the cases of those which are provided in the Terms of Fair Use in the copyright law of your region, such as the Article 22 of the _COPYRIGHT LAW OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA_, may constitute a violation of the copyright of the original author.
* [This version of atlas](http://worldmap.lurito.com) which has been translated and localized some contents by [Lurito](https://github.com/Lurito) is only for classroom teaching or scientific research.
* Because of the difference between studies, there may be some discrepancy between this atlas and some others. In the case of examination, please answer it according to your textbooks.
* The data of this atlas is updated from 4000 BC to AD 2017.
* In order to reduce the file size, the Japanese original author used Traditional Chinese character(e.g., 总→總) or Japanese Kanji(e.g., 总→総) instead of simplified Chinese, and used translations usually appear in Hong Kong, Taiwan or Japan(e.g., Theresa May is called '文翠珊' in Hong Kong but '特蕾莎·梅' in mainland China.) instead of those usually appear in mainland China. These make the main readers, people in mainland China, have trouble in reading it. If you can help to Chinese localization these contents, I shall be deeply grateful.
