### Precursory Statement
---
* Strongly advising to use landscape mode while exploring on mobile devices.
* Because of the difference between studies, there may be some discrepancy between this atlas and some others. In the case of examination, please answer it according to your textbooks.
* In order to reduce the file size, the Japanese original author used Traditional Chinese character(e.g., 总→總) or Japanese Kanji(e.g., 总→総) instead of simplified Chinese, and used translations usually appear in Hong Kong, Taiwan or Japan(e.g., Theresa May is called '文翠珊' in Hong Kong but '特蕾莎·梅' in mainland China.) instead of those usually appear in mainland China. These may make the main readers of this version of atlas, people in mainland China, have trouble in reading it. If you can help to Chinese localize these contents, I shall be deeply grateful.

### Instructions of Use
